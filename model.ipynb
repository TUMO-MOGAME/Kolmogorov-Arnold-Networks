    "Objective: This project aims to explore the architecture of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Specifically, the study will investigate how replacing fixed activation functions with learnable splines affects model accuracy and interpretability (Liu et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope: Inspired by recent research into non-invasive diagnostics, the project will implement a KAN to predict health risks—such as dementia—using physiological markers like Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and physical performance metrics (Ali, 2025). The goal is to demonstrate that \"pruning\" a KAN can lead to a highly transparent model that maintains high predictive performance even with a reduced, non-invasive feature set."
